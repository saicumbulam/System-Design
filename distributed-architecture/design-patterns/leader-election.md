# Leader Election

## What

Coordinate the actions performed by a collection of collaborating instances in a distributed application by electing one instance as the leader that assumes responsibility for managing the others.

## Why

The task instances might run separately for much of the time, but it might also be necessary to coordinate the actions of each instance to ensure that they don’t conflict, cause contention for shared resources, or accidentally interfere with the work that other task instances are performing.

## How

A single task instance should be elected to act as the leader, and this instance should coordinate the actions of the other subordinate task instances. If all of the task instances are running the same code, they are each capable of acting as the leader. Therefore, the election process must be managed carefully to prevent two or more instances taking over the leader role at the same time.

## When to use

Use this pattern when the tasks in a distributed application, such as a cloud-hosted solution, need careful coordination and there's no natural leader.

Avoid making the leader a bottleneck in the system. The purpose of the leader is to coordinate the work of the subordinate tasks, and it doesn't necessarily have to participate in this work itself—although it should be able to do so if the task isn't elected as the leader.
