# Throttling

1. The load on a cloud application typically varies over time based on the number of active users or the types of activities they are performing.
3. Control the consumption of resources used by an instance of an application. This can allow the system to continue to function and meet service level agreements,

## When to use

* To ensure that a system continues to meet service level agreements.
* To prevent a single tenant from monopolizing the resources provided by an application.
* To handle bursts in activity.
* To help cost-optimize a system by limiting the maximum resource levels needed to keep it functioning.

  **How**

  several throttling strategies, including:

* Rejecting requests from an individual user who's already accessed system APIs more than n times per second over a given period of time.
* Disabling or degrading the functionality of selected nonessential services so that essential services can run unimpeded with sufficient resources. For example, if the application is streaming video output, it could switch to a lower resolution.
* Using load leveling to smooth the volume of activity. In a multi-tenant environment, this approach will reduce the performance for every tenant. If the system must support a mix of tenants with different SLAs, the work for high-value tenants might be performed immediately. Requests for other tenants can be held back, and handled when the backlog has eased.
