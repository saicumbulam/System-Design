# What
Create separate backend services to be consumed by specific frontend applications or interfaces. This pattern is useful when you want to avoid customizing a single backend for multiple interfaces.

# How
Create one backend per user interface. Fine-tune the behavior and performance of each backend to best match the needs of the frontend environment
