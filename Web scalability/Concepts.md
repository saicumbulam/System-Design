## Scalability
- Ability to adjust the capacity of the system to cost-efficiently fulfill the demands. 
- The ability to scale is measured in different dimension:
  - Handling more data
  - Handling higher concurrency levels. Higher concurrency means more 
    open connections, more active threads, more messages being processed at the same time, 
    and more CPU context switches.
  - Handling higher interaction rates: how often your clients exchange information with your servers
